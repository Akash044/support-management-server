## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akash044/support-management-server.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd support-management-server
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following content:
   ```bash
   DB_PASS=<db_password>
   DB_USER=<db_username>
   DB_NAME=SUPPORT_DB
   DB_COL1=issues
   DB_COL2=last_request_time
   PORT=<port_number>
   ```
   ### Replace <db_password>, <db_username>, and <port_number> with your actual database password, username of your mongodb database, and the port where you want to run the project.

5. Run the project in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080. You need third-part api client(such as POSTMAN) to access the api.
